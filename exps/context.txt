TITLE: Me [26M] feeling like I'm competing with my girlfriend's [22F] family

POST: I bought my girlfriend a sterling silver necklace with a Sapphire for Christmas. I got it on sale, regular $175, I paid $50. Today she goes to her parents house (we don't get along at all). They bought her a necklace too (they probably spent $1000 on her this year). Her parents gave her 3 large gifts prior to Christmas. She walks in today and the first thing she says, while carrying two huge bags, is "I have too much stuff". Then she proceeds to tell me about how the necklace they bought her costed 6x as much as the one I bought her. She can't understand why I'm annoyed. Am I wrong for feeling annoyed? I feel like it was just rude of her to go on about how expensive the gifts she received from her family were.
